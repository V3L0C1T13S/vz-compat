# vz-compat
Vizality Compatibilty plugin for Rikka and Rikka-like Discord clients.
Works by loading a subsystem for Vizality onto your Discord client, allowing Vizality to run alongside your other compatibility plugins.

NOTE: Unlike PC-compat, this plugin does NOT provide a full replacement for Vizality libraries, and does not plan on doing so out of respect for the developers. You must have proper access to the Vizality repository in order to use this plugin.
